## undefined vs not defined
### undefined
-undefined is a special key word, that represents respective variable is not assigned any value 
-undefined not empty it takes place until the value is assigned  
```javascript
var a;
console.log(a)//undefined
a = 10
console.log(a)//10
a = "hello"
console.log(a)//hello
```
-javascript is a loosely typed language, with var declared variables we can assign different data types to same variable
-also called weekly typed language and more flexible language
-never assign undefined to any variable it not good practice 

### not defined
-it means you have not declared any variable but you are trying to access unknown one
```javascript
var a;
console.log(x)//x is not defined because js did not allocate any memory to x as we have not declared 
```
